## 第二与第三部分

### Describe your favorite place in your house where you can relax

I think it must be my study, which is a small room in my house but I like it very much.

There is a personal computer on the table, many books on the bookshelf and there are several movie posters on the wall.

If I want to stay alone to relax, I will go to the study because my parents and friends won't interrupt me when I'm in the study. And I can read some books, have a cup of coffee or watch a great movie, which I enjoy very much.

If I'm tired, I can just take a nap on the sofa and forget all the troubles in daily life for a while.

Therefore, I think the study is my favorite place to relax.

+ Why is it difficult for some people to relax?

+ What are the benefits of doing exercise?  
  The benefits of exercising are numerous, making it an essential component of a healthy and balanced lifestyle. 锻炼的好处非常多，这使得其成为健康均衡的生活方式的重要组成部分。  
  Exercise can help to improve cardiovascular health, increase flexibility and strength, boost mood, and reduce the risk of chronic health conditions.  
  Additionally, physical activity has been shown to help individuals manage stress and anxiety, improve sleep, and increase energy levels.  
  Engaging in regular exercise can also lead to improved self-esteem, increased confidence, and a greater sense of well-being.
+ Do people in your country exercise after work?  
  Well, I think it depends on where people live. For those living in cities, there are enough sports facilities around their houses so they often exercise after work. But for those who live in the rural areas, sports amenities are not adequate so they may not do exercise as frequently as people in cities.
+ What is the place where people spend most of their time at home?  
  In most homes, I guess the place where people spend most of their time is the living room. The living room is used for entertaning guests, relaxing such as watching TV, spending time with family menbers and friends. And in the living room there is usually a big and confortable sofa which nearly nobody would show resistance to.
+ Do you think there should be classes for training young people and children how to relax?  
  Yeah. I think it's necessary to teach young people and children to learn how to relax. 




### Describe an unusual meal you had

Last year I enjoyed an unusual meal on a home party which was launched and organized by the class monitor.

Before the party, we made some preparations. First of all, a questionnaire was conducted to check how many students would like to take part in the party. After that, we made a shopping list and then went to a supermarket to buy the raw materials needed for cooking dinner.

We arrived at the destination at around 6 pm and then began to make the dinner. Everything was delicious and we had a pleasant conservation with each other.

After the dinner, we enjoyed the snacks that we had bought in the supermarket and we did many interesting activities such as billizrds, singing, table games and video games.

I think this meal is unusual because it is the first time for the classmates to gather together to eat a meal and through the activity we get to know each other better. What's more, the party house is beautifully decorated, which has left me a deep impression.

Overall, it is an unforgettable experience and I really love this meal. I'm looking forward to it for the next time.
