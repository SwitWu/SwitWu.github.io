## Part 1 必考话题

### Hometown

+ Where is your hometown? Please describe your hometown a little.  
  My hometown is Huanggang, which is a middle-sized city situated in the east of Hubei province. It is adjacent to the capital city---Wuhan. My hometown is famous for its primary and secondary education. Every year a large number of students go to the top 1 universities through the college entrance examination. And there are some tourist attractions in my hometown, the most famous one of which is the Turtle mountain. During April of every year, it will be full of azalea(杜鹃花), which is pretty amazing.
+ Do you like your hometown?  
  Yes. I like my hometown for several reasons.
  + Tranquility of country life.
  + Go hiking in the mountains, beautiful sceneries.
  + The people there are friendly and helpful.
+ Is there anything you dislike about it?  
  Well, there are several aspects that I dislike about my hometown. I think the biggest problem is the transport, especially the public transport. Since there is no subway and the number of buses is not enough, it is inconvenient for me to go to school, go shopping and just go to the express delivery center to fetch my goods.
+ How long have you been living there?  
  I have been living there for about 18 years during which I had finished my work in primary school and high school. It was 2017 when I left my hometown to continue my study in Wuhan University.
+ Do you like living there?  
  Yeah I like living in my hometown. I can enjoy the beautiful sceneries there. When I have some spare time, I can go hiking in the mountains, breathing the fresh air and listening to many kinds of brids' singing. If I'm lucky, I can even see some wild animals such as hares(野兔) and squirrels. What's more, I'm fond of the tranquility of the country life. It can let me escape from the hustle and bustle in cities and stay focused on my work.
+ Do you think you will continue living there for a long time?  
  No. Since I plan to find a job in some city in the future and I'll definitely buy a new house in that city, I won't live there for a long time.
+ Did you learn about the history of your hometown at school?  
  No. When I was in the high school, I learned the ancient and modern history of China. But teachers never taught me about the history of my hometown. Maybe they thought that it was a kind of work that we should finish after class by ourselves.

## Place

### The city you live in

+ What city do you live in?  
  I live in Wuhan, which is the capital city of Hubei province. It's a beautiful city with high economy, convenient transport and large population.
+ Do you like your city? Why?  
  Yes. I like Wuhan very much. There are many places of interest in Wuhan such as the Yellow Crane Tower, the Yangtze River and the East Lake. When I have free time, I can go there to relax myself. What's more, there are lots of shopping malls near my school, so it's convenient for me to buy goods, watch movies and eat in the restaurants.
+ How long have you lived in this city?  
  I have lived in Wuhan for 6 years. In 2017 I came to Wuhan to start my undergraduate's program. And in 2021 I started my postgraduate's program. Maybe I'll leave here in the next year.
+ Are there big changes in this city?  
  Yeah. Wuhan is changing with a high speed. Especially the subway system, there years the government has invested a large amount of money in constructing the underground transportation. By now there have been 8 subway lines in Wuhan, which faciliate local people's daily transport.
+ Is this city your permanent residence?  
  I'm not sure. It depends on where my future work place will be located. If I can find a stable job in Wuhan in the future, then I'll consider buy a house in Wuhan and choose it as my permanent residence.

### Library

+ Do you often go to the library?  
  (基本不去，学院有专门的研修室，所以没必要去图书馆自习；图书馆人太多，闷热)  
  Hardly do I go to the library. There are specific learning rooms provided by my school so there is no necessity to go to the library for self-study. What's more, there are too many people in the library and I think the library is too stuffy for me to stay there for a long time.
+ What do you usually do in the library?  
  (借书+小组讨论+期末复习)  
  Usually I go to library to borrow some mathematical books or search for some interesting extracurricular books such as biographies. Sometimes I need to give some presentations in class, then I'll reverse a seminar room in the library and discuss with my group members. And when the final exam is coming, I'll revise in the library.
+ Did you go to library when you were a child?  
  No. When I was a child I lived in a small town where there was no library.
+ Do Chinese kids often go to library?  
  I'm not sure. Kids in the rural areas seldom go to library.
  But children in the cities may go to library frequently.

### Schools

1. Where do you go to school?  
  I'm currently a college student at Wuhan University, which is a beautiful and famous university in China.
2. Do you go to a good school?  
  Definitely. There are abundant teaching resources, beautiful campus sceneries, excellent classmates and various sports facilities in the school. So I think the school is very good.
3. Do you like your teachers?
    + Yes. Some teachers have a sense of humour, make me stay focused in class.
    + Some can use different teaching aids, make class more stimulating.
4. Do you like your current learning atmosphere?  
  Yes. We have periodic reports and discussions in the seminar group and the school also regularly invites some renowned scholars to give some presentations to us. So the learning atmosphere is very strong.
5. What's the differences between your school and other schools?  
  My school has many historical buildings and Sakura. From mid to late March, many tourists come to my school to enjoy the beautiful sceneries.
6. Is there anything you want to change about your school?  
    + More school bus stations.
    + Build more canteens in some area.
    + Improve the internet survice, it is unstable.

## Object

### Language($*$)

1. What languages can you speak?  
  I can speak Chinese and English. Chinese is my mother tongue so I can speak it fluently and English is my second language. I started learning English from primary school.
2. What languages would you like to learn in the future?  
  I want to learn French in the future because France is a romantic country and I would like to go there in the future. What's more, France is a mathematical powerhouse, so mastering France will make it easier for me to communicate with French mathematicians.
3. How do you learn a foreign language?  
  Well, I think it's a pretty complicated thing. Aprt from the basic learning in classes, I usually buy some extra books to learn the grammar and writing. And I often watch some English videos on bilibili, which is a video-sharing platform. This can improve my listening and speaking skills.
4. How are languages taught and learned in your school?  
  Well, the school will distribute specific textbooks to every student. And in classes the teachers will teach us vocabularies, grammars and writing skills.


### Ice Cream($*$)

1. Do you like ice cream?  
  I'm a big fan of ice cream especially when it's sunny and hot. And I think it's the icy and sweet texture that attracts me most.
2. Do you eat ice cream a lot?  
  Not really. Although ice cream fits my taste, I don't eat ice cream too much because it contains a lot of sugar and some fat which is detrimental to our body. And some people said that "If you eat a lot of ice cream, it's gonna accelerate your aging process." So, yeah, I don't eat a lot of ice cream.
3. Did you eat ice cream when you were a child?  
  No, I spent my childhood in the countryside where at that time there was neither ice cream nor ice lolly.
4. Are there shops selling ice cream near the place where you live?  
  Yeah. There is a big supermarket and several convenience shops in the neighborhood and they all sell ice cream. Therefore it's pretty easy for me for buy ice cream nowadays.
5. Can you make ice cream yourself?  
  No, I can't. I think the procedure to make an ice cream might be a little complicated and I have never learned how to make ice cream. And nowadys it's pretty convenient to buy ice cream from the shops, so I think it's unnecessary to make ice cream by myself.

### Rain($*$)

1. Do you like rainy days?  
   That depends on whether the rain is heavy or not. I am fond of some light rain since it can make the air fresher and make the weather cooler. But I don't like the heavy rain since it can wet my pant leg even with the protection of the umbrella.
2. Does it rain much in your city?  
   Not pretty much. I think the weather in Wuhan is pretty weird. Sometimes it's sunny and hot in the morning, but there is a sudden downpour in the afternoon. And typically there are about one fifth of days that are rainy.
3. Would you like to live in a city that is dry or wet?  
   I would choose to live in a dry city because it is possible and convenient for me to go out to do some sports, meet with my friends or just take a walk on sunny days. And when it's rainy, I can only stay at home, which is pretty boring.
4. Would you change your plan if it rained?  
  I think it will depend on the plan itself. If I'm going to do some outdoor activities like going hiking or going cycling with my friends, then I'll definitely change my plan. But if I'm gonna watch a movie or have a dinner in the restaurant, then I won't change my mind since the weather won't influence my mood, nor will it influence the plan.

### Bags

1. Do you usually carry a bag?  
   Yes. Basically I carry a bag everyday. Since every morning I have to take many items such as my books, my personal computer, my water bottle and my keys with me, a bag is necessarily needed to put them all together.
2. Do you change your bags often?  
   No. I think it's unnecessary to change bags often. In my opinion, bags are just for practical use and I won't change my bag until it is broken. I have used my current bag for five years and it's still in good condition. I think maybe I'll use it for another five years.
3. What kinds of bags would you use when travelling?  
  I will choose a bag that can contain a lot of things and that's not expensive. If you carry a quite expensive one, sometimes you may get yourself in trouble because your bag is likely to be stolen my someone else if you're not careful enough. So I'll choose the useful and practical ones.
4. Is bag an ideal gift?  
  For most girls and boys, I think a bag might be an ideal gift for them. But for me, I usually don't spend too much money on bags, clothes, shoes and so on. So I'd prefer some gifts that have a special meaning.
5. Did you use a backpack when you were a child?  
  Yes definitely. I think most Chinese students including me used backpacks when we were primary school students since we need to take our textbooks, workbooks(练习册) and stationery along with us every day. So yeah I used a backpack when I was a child.

### Music

1. What music do you like?  
    + Pop music, easy to follow and learn, strike a chord with me.
    + Pinao Music, make me feel relaxed, use it as a sleep aid.

    + Classical music, hard to get what the writer wants to express.

3. Do you often listen to one type of music?  
  Yes. Some singers I like very much, listen to some album of them for a long time.
4. What music do your friend like? Do you enjoy the same type of music?  
  One of my friends like classical music very much, he learned to play classical music on the violin when he was young.
5. What's the most popular type of music where you live?  
  It depends. For young people, it must be pop music. For the elderly people, it might be the folk music and opera.
6. What singer or musician would you like to see in person?  
  Jackey Cheung. He is a famous HongKong singer and actor who has won many awards. Excel at performing several kinds of music style.

### Art

1. Do you like art?  
  Yes I like art. Although I'm not talented in drawing, I still enjoy appreciating the paintings and sculptures because it can help to release my stress and improve my aesthetic taste. And I also like calligraphy very much. There are many famous calligraphers in chinese history and I often try to learn from their works. I think this can improve my penmanship.
2. Do you like visiting art galleries?  
  Yes definitely. I visit art galleries quite often. Every time I visit a new city I would search for the local art galleries of that city and spend time there with my friends. Art galleries are good places to relax myself and take photos.
3. Do you want to be an artist?  
  To be honest not really. On the one hand, I'm not talented in arts. On the other hand, for those who become an artist or want to be an artist, it requires them to be quite persistent and passionate about art, which is quite hard for me to do that. So yeah I don't really want to be an artist.
4. Do you like modern art or traditional art?  
  It's hard to say because I can't differentiate exactly between modern art and traditional art. Maybe I like both because they have their own strong points.
  + traditional art: provide a basis in aesthetic level, show people the details of artwork
  + modern art: break the mould, reflect artists' innovative thoughts

### Keys

1. Do you always bring a lot of keys with you?  
  No. I live in the school dormitary, so I only have to take the key of the dormitary and that of my electric motor car with me.
2. Have you ever lost your keys?  
  Never. That's probably I am not a scatterbrain.
  I always put the keys into my bag or my pockets. Before I leave one place to go to another place, I'll check the keys to make sure they're here with me. Just in case that the keys drop onto the ground, I can hear the noticeable sound.

### T-shirt

+ Do you like wearing T-shirts?  
  (百搭+舒适+容易洗)  
  Yes I'm fond of wearing T-shirts. They go with everything, whether shorts(短裤) or pants(长裤). And it's confortable to wear T-shirts compared with wearing shirts which are required in some formal circumstances. What's more, T-shirts are easily washed.
+ How often do you wear T-shrts?  
  To be honest I wear T-shirts nearly everyday in summer. The pure cotton ones are my favorite coz they are comfortable to wear and they don’t smell awful after workout. I have bought many T-shirts online or in the physical shops.
+ Do you like T-shirts with pictures or prints?  
  For me, I don't like T-shirts that are totally blank without any pictures or prints since they'll look monotonious. And I am fond of T-shirts with some words or just a brand badge on them. That will make T-shirts look simple and fashionable.
+ Do you think older people who wear T-shirts are fashionable?  
  (分情况：胖子和体型好的人)  
  Well, I think that will depend on different people. If an senior people who is overweight wears a baggy T-shirt, this person might look like he or she is in low spirits. If the person has a good figure and wears a T-shirt that goes well with the trousers like the jeans, then he or she must look fashionable.
+ Would you buy T-shirts as souvenirs on vacation?  
  (不会，旅行时关注点都在景点、美食、摄影上面，另外如果想买纪念品，我会选择一些手工制品，比如折扇或者小雕刻品)  
  No. When I have a vacation, I usually pay all my attention on the tourist attractions, local delicious food and taking photographs. And if I want to buy some souvenirs, I'll choose to search for some local artefacts like a folding fan or some little sculptures. It think they are more memorable.


### Jewelry

+ Do you often wear jewelry?  
  To be honest, I don't buy any jewelry since I don't want to spend time and money on the jewelries and I think it's unnecessary for me to wear the jewelry to go outside. As long as my clothes are comfortable for me, then I'll be satisfied.
+ What type of jewelry do you like?
+ Do you usually buy jewelry?
+ Why do you think some people wear a piece of jewelry for a long time?  
  (将首饰视作护身符 lucky charm，比如有的孩子戴的生肖吊坠 zodiac pendants；也有可能是来自某个重要的人，具有情感价值)    
  I guess one of the reasons is the jewelry is like the lucky charm for them. It’s a kind of tradition in China you know. People wear zodiac pendants(生肖吊坠) from childhood. Another thing is, the jewelry may be given by someone who means a lot to that person, so it’s of great sentimental value.

### Outer space and stars

  (课程+课外)  
  Yes. I began to learn something about outer space and stars since I was in high school. At that time teachers taught us some basic knowledge. And I also have also acquired some knowledge through watching some videos and reading some extracurricular books about that.
+ Do you like science fiction movies? Why?  
  (喜欢，因为画面和特效很壮观，给人视觉冲击、创造了一个不同的世界，让观众从平淡的生活中脱离出来)  
  Yes definitely. One of the reasons is that the images and special effects in science fiction movies are spectacular and they can give people lots of visual impacts. And the directors are usually creating a different world, which can make the audiences escape from the mundane life for a while.
+ Do you want to know more about outer space?  
  (是的，因为我对外太空感兴趣，现在还有很多未解之谜)  
  Yes I do because I'm always curious about outer space. There are still many unresolved mysteries like whether there exists highly developed civilization in the outer space and whether it is feasible for human beings to migrate to another planet.
+ Do you want to go into outer space in the future?  
  No not really. First I think it might be too expensive for me to afford the space traveling. And even if I have enough money in the future, I still don't dare to have a try because it's dangerous and I'm afraid it might be a one-way trip.

### Chocolate

## 地点类

### Describe a place you plan to travel to that is far away from your home in the future($*$)

套用题目 [Describe another city you want to stay for a short time](#describe-another-city-you-want-to-stay-for-a-short-time)

### Describe the ideal house you would like to have($*$)

+ 位置：城市中心（交通方便、购物城）
+ 环境：外部环境（附近有公园、地铁站），内部环境（面积大、设计装修良好、有书房）
+ 总结：向往很久，想要实现梦想还有很多事要做

For this topic I want to talk about an ideal house that I have always dreamed of in my mind.

First of all, I want the house to be situated in the city center because there are many advantages. For example, the transport will be convenient so I can go anywhere I want within a short time. In the city center there are many shopping malls so I can go shopping, watch a movie or eat in the restaurant very easily.

Then I wonna talk about the environment of the house. For the outside, I hope there is a park near my house so I could take a walk and breathe the fresh air in the park after work. And it's better to have a subway station in the neighborhood since taking the subway is economical and you don't have to worry about traffic congestion. And for inside environment, I wish its area is big enough so I can entertain my relatives and friends without worrying that there won't have enough space. And I hope the house is well designed and decorated so that it will look confortable and cozy. What's more, a study is necessary for me since I'm a bookworm and I need some separate space which can help me escape from the noisy environment and keep myself focused.

The aforementioned conditions satisfy all my expectations, so I believe it's my ideal house. To be honest, I've been dreaming about it for a long time. But to achieve this dream, there are still many things to do.

### Describe a place you have been to where there were lots of people($*$)

  + 内部环境 pretty small but well decorated, light is soft so it's cozy to drink there with your friends, workers are patient and passionate, they'll introduce the latest flavor to the customers
+ 饮品：sell milk tea with dozens of tastes which can basically satisfy everyone's flavor

+ 发展：this brand originated from Changsha, it has only three shops in Wuhan, so it has gained great popularity since the day it is opened. I think it will become more successful with local people's recommedation.

### Describe another city you want to stay for a short time

Well, I would like to stay in Beijing for a short time. As is known to us all, Beijing is the capital city and political center of China. It's famous all around the world since it has witnessed many important international activities such as the 2008 Olympic Games. What's more, Beijing is a historical city because it is the capital city of several dynasties in the history of China.

Although I have known Beijing since I was a child, I have never been there. So I want to take a visit to Beijing in the near future, maybe the next summer vacation. And my friend Jack said that he also wants to visit Beijing as well, so I can invite him to go with me.

I think I can do a lot of things in Beijing. First of all, I'll visit some places of interest, such as the Great Wall, the Forbidden City and the Summer Palace. And of course I can't miss the flag-rising ceremony on the Tian'anmen square. It's a spectacular activity which can stimulate people's patriotic enthusiasm and national pride. What's more, I will go to Peking University and Tsinghua University to meet with my old classmates. Since I haven't seen them for a long time, I hope I'll have an exciting conservation with them.

However, I'll not stay there for a long time. On the one hand, it will cost me a lot of money since I have to pay for the fares of food, accomodation, transportation and the tickets for the tourist attractions. On the other hand, I have to come back to my university for my work.

### Describe a new development in the area where you live

### Describe a noisy place you have been to

For this topic, I want to talk about the Hankou Railway Station, which is situated in the west of Wuhan.

I can still remember it was in January when chinese spring festival was coming, I bought a train ticket online and then took the subway to go to the train station.

The station was packed with people since a large number of citizens including students and workers made their journey back home at this time every year. They carried all kinds of bags---backpacks, suitcases, briefcases and even big bags containing their daily necessities. All the seats were occupied so I had to stand in a corner to wait for the train.

It was really noisy. Some people were talking with their family or friends, with smiles on their faces, which seemed to express their exhilaration for the oncoming reunions with their family members at home. But I couldn't hear exactly what they were talking about. Some people were making phone calls, maybe they were making plans for the next journeys after getting off from the train. And the broadcast in the station was announcing the information of the trains with a high volume to make sure that every passenger won't miss the important notification.

During that time my mom made a phone call to me, but I couldn't hear clearly what she was speaking to me. So I had to hung up and chat with her by sending the text messages. I don't like too noisy environments like this. Maybe the next time when I need to go home, I will choose an earlier time to avoid the huge crowds.

### Describe your favorite place in your house where you can relax

I think it must be my study, which is a small room in my house but I like it very much.

There is a personal computer on the table, many books on the bookshelf and there are several movie posters on the wall.

If I want to stay alone to relax, I will go to the study because my parents and friends won't interrupt me when I'm in the study. And I can read some books, have a cup of coffee or watch a great movie, which I enjoy very much.

If I'm tired, I can just take a nap on the sofa and forget all the troubles in daily life for a while.

Therefore, I think the study is my favorite place to relax.

+ Why is it difficult for some people to relax?

+ What are the benefits of doing exercise?  
  The benefits of exercising are numerous, making it an essential component of a healthy and balanced lifestyle. 锻炼的好处非常多，这使得其成为健康均衡的生活方式的重要组成部分。  
  Exercise can help to improve cardiovascular health, increase flexibility and strength, boost mood, and reduce the risk of chronic health conditions.  
  Additionally, physical activity has been shown to help individuals manage stress and anxiety, improve sleep, and increase energy levels.  
  Engaging in regular exercise can also lead to improved self-esteem, increased confidence, and a greater sense of well-being.
+ Do people in your country exercise after work?  
  Well, I think it depends on where people live. For those living in cities, there are enough sports facilities around their houses so they often exercise after work. But for those who live in the rural areas, sports amenities are not adequate so they may not do exercise as frequently as people in cities.
+ What is the place where people spend most of their time at home?  
  In most homes, I guess the place where people spend most of their time is the living room. The living room is used for entertaning guests, relaxing such as watching TV, spending time with family menbers and friends. And in the living room there is usually a big and confortable sofa which nearly nobody would show resistance to.
+ Do you think there should be classes for training young people and children how to relax?  
  Yeah. I think it's necessary to teach young people and children to learn how to relax. 

### Describe a place you visited where the air was polluted

+ 情节设计：去大连旅游，途径太原，父亲想去见一见他的老朋友，所以就在太原逗留了
+ 旅馆在工业区，被大型生产工厂和高耸的烟囱包围，空气被工厂的排放物污染（我们害怕如果我们打开窗户，空气会让我们窒息），天空是深灰色的，能见度很低；街道上只有少数人在匆匆行走，大多数都戴着口罩

For this topic I would like to talk about Taiyuan, which is a city in Shanxi province. Last summer my parents took me to Dalian for vacation. But on the half way, my dad wanted to meet his old friend and so we stopped in Taiyuan. My mum and I were left in a hotel waiting for him.

Our hotel was situated in the industrial area, which was surrounded by large production plants and towering chimneys, from which thick and dusty smoke was rising up. The air was contaminated by emissions from the factories and we were afraid that if we opened the window, the air would choke us. The sky was dark gray, with poor visibility. In the streets, there were only a few people walking in a hurry, mostly wearing masks. We were stricken by the outrageous air condition and left the city shortly afterward.

It is the most polluted place I have ever been to. It made me realize that if we don’t stop letting off waste air, our world will become hell. So I do hope the government would carry out policies to improve the condition of the air. I am sure they must have done something right now. Because quite frankly, the pollution there was appalling, and even survival would become a problem then.

For this topic, I would like a talk about a website called Math Stack Exchange, which is a forum for discussing various mathematical problems.

The layout of the website is very clear. The website is divided into two columns, the left of which lists the latest mathematical questions asked by different users and the right column contains the tags attached to the questions and many other hot network questions.（网站的布局）

And the website is very easy to use. There is a conspicuous button at the top-right corner of the website and if you want to ask a question, just click it, then write down your problem and what you have tried for the problem.（网站的使用）

I have used this website for several years. When I'm stuck with some very difficult questions that I can't resolve by myself, I'll resort to this website and typically within several hours someone will post a right answer under my question. What's more, sometimes I also help others on this site. For example, last week I saw an interesting question that is related to my research direction. It took me aroung two hours to solve the question but I felt really excited.

Overall, I have learned a lot from this website and I'll definitely recommend it to my classmates.

### 9. Describe a piece of technology you own that you feel is difficult to use

Well, for this topic I would like to talk about a pair of Bluetooth earbuds that I bought last year. To be honest, it sometimes even drove me up the wall[^drive-up-the-wall]!

Since I was fed up with dealing with the wires that always got tangled up when I was listening to the music or watching some videos, I decided to buy a pair of wireless Bluetooth earbuds which were a new technology a few years ago. I had thought that things would get better, but it turned out that I was wrong.

Every time I tried to connect the earbuds with my mobile phone, I had to go through a series of cumbersome procedures---turning them on, putting them into pairing mode and hoping that my phone could recognize them. And sometimes even though they had connected successfully, they often fell disconnected or had other connection problems. And the weirdest phenomenon was that sometimes one of them was connected but the other didn't.

I couldn't count the number of times when I had to fiddle (around) with[^fiddle-with] them to make them work properly. I thought that my choice for this pair of earbuds was a mistake since it was a waste of money and time.

Overall, I felt disappointed about the earbuds. I had expected for a convenient and comfortable listening experience, but in reality, I had to struggle to use this kind of technology. Perhaps in the future I'll buy another pair of Bluetooth earbuds which can provide me with better services.

[^drive-up-the-wall]: drive sb up the wall means to make someone extremely angry
[^fiddle-with]: fiddle (around) with something means to make small changes to something to try to make it work

+ What technology do people currently use?  
  按人群分类：
  + students, teachers, white and blue-collar workers: they usually use some electronic devices for work and research. For example, computers and laptops are some of the most important equipments for them to accomplish their work.
  + housewives and nannies: technology that is related to household chores could help them make the work a piece of cake. For instance, they can use washing machine to help them wash and dry the clothes. At the same time,  the range hood(抽油烟机) and the rice cooker can make the process of cooking easier and more comfortable. What's more, to help the house spick and span, the floor vacuum robot can help a lot.
  + Finally, I think that the mobile phones are used by nearly all of the individuals since it's an important method for people to communicate with their family, friends and so on.


### 10. Describe an advertisement you have seen but you did not like

About weeks ago, when streaming videos on bilibili, a video-sharing website, I came across a short video entitled: Three ways to lose 10 kilos in a short time. I guess it is eye-catching to everyone who wants to lose weight, and I was no exception.

When I clicked on it, a slim and attractive young lady, probably an online influencer, showed up and started to talk about how she had lost 10 kilograms in three months without doing any exercise. In the beginning, she introduced her diet, which is low-carbon and high in protein This part took only less than a minute. But when coming to the last tip, it became a promotion of a supplement that can block carbohydrate absorption(碳水化合物的吸收). She boasted about how effective it was for almost 5 minutes. Then came the part about how viewers can get a discount from her link. Not until then did I realize that this video was not an experience–sharing video but an advertisement for a new product.

At that moment, my excitement immediately turned into disappointment. Thinking back, I also found that the information conveyed in the video was unreliable. Because it gave the audience, especially young people a false hope that we could get a good shape only by taking those “magical pills”. Nowadays, more and more companies try to sell their products through those short-videos or live selling. And sometimes we can’t tell if what the anchors say is true. Instead of spreading helpful information for the sake of the general public, they only care about making a profit. This is why I have a deep- seated aversion to most of them.

### 事件类

### 1. Describe an enjoyable experience in your childhood($*$)

在我十岁的时候，我爸爸要到武汉见一位老朋友，他带我一起来武汉看一看。这是我第一次来武汉这样的大城市，在这以前我一直在乡村生活学习。

我们乘坐高铁从家乡来到武汉，然后我们乘坐地铁到达目的地，我第一次知道有地铁这个玩意儿，而且地下交通系统竟然可以如此发达。
在爸爸的朋友家吃饭午饭后，我们去了武汉最大的动物园，在那里我见到了各种各样的野生动物，比如长颈鹿、梅花鹿、河马和大象，这让我感受到了大自然的神奇，初步领略了生物多样性。
第二天我们就回家了，我觉得这是一次令人激动的经历，因为我见到了很多以前没有见多的事物，大大增长了我的见识。

When I was ten years old, my father had to meet an old friend in Wuhan. Since I was always curious about the outside world, I asked my dad to bring me along and eventually he agreed. It was my first time to visit such a big city like Wuhan, before then I had never left the small countryside in my hometown.

We travelled from my hometown to Wuhan by high speed train and then we took the metro to our destination. It was the first time I knew there was such a thing as a metro and that the underground transport system could be so well developed.

After having lunch at my dad's friend's house, we went to the largest zoo in Wuhan, where I saw all kinds of wild animals, such as giraffes, plum deer, hippos and elephants, which gave me a sense of the wonders of nature and an initial appreciation of biodiversity.

Then my dad took me to the Museum of Hubei Province, which I witnessed numerous cultural relics such as the Bronze Chime-bells and the sword of Goujian. From this experience, I appreciated the wisdom of ancient people and how time-honored my country is.

We went home the next day and I found it an exciting experience as I had seen many things that I had never seen before and this short journey greatly increased my knowledge and broadened my horizon.

### 2. Describe an occasion when you spent time with a young child($*$)

去年暑假我堂姐把她的孩子带到我家来玩，由于她要和我妈妈去果园里摘些果子，她就把小孩丢给我来照看。

小孩子非常调皮，刚开始他一直在客厅里追我家的小狗，非常吵闹，搞得我都没有心情看书。所以我就在想有什么东西能够转移他的注意力，让他消停一会儿。我突然想到小孩子们都喜欢看动画片，于是我在电脑上搜了几部动画片，但是他都说不喜欢看，这令我非常沮丧。就在这时，我看到桌上有一本数独，我试探性地问他敢不敢挑战数独游戏，他带着骄傲地语气说道：“有什么不敢的，我就喜欢挑战自己”，于是，我向他介绍了数独游戏的规则，就这样，他玩起了数独游戏，同时周围也变得安静了下来。我长舒了一口气，终于可以静下心来看会儿书了。

Last summer my cousin brought her son over to my house to play and as she had to go to the orchard with my mum to pick some fruit, she left the boy with me to look after.

The child was very naughty and at first he kept chasing my puppy around the living room, making so much noise that I couldn't concentrate on my work. So I was thinking of something that could distract him from the little dog for a while. It occurred to me that children like to watch cartoons, so I searched for a few on the computer, but he said he didn't like them, which was very frustrating to me. At that moment, I saw a Sudoku book on the table and I tentatively asked him whether he dared to challenge himself to a Sudoku game. He said with a proud tone of voice, "What's there to be afraid of, I just like to challenge myself", so I introduced the basic rules of Sudoku to him and after that, he played the game while the surroundings became quiet. I breathed a sigh of relief because I was finally able to settle down and read for a while.

From this experience I realized that taking care of a little child is not an easy task you need to use your patience and wisdom to keep a balance between looking after him and finishing your own work.

For this topic I want to talk about an interesting job which is to become a traveling vlogger.

In bilibili---a video-sharing website, I have seen many video uploaders travel around around China, some even around the world, and take videos to share their daily life. I think it's pretty exciting and cool.

However, it's not easy to become a traveling vlogger. You have to acquire many skills. Firstly you have to use simple equipments to sleep and cook since it's impossible for you to take all kinds items along with you. And you need to adapt all kinds of harsh natural environments. Whether it's freezing cold or scorching hot, you have to go ahead. What's more, you need learn how to take videos and how to edit videos such as adding subtitles(字幕) and backgroung music into the videos.

As for the reasons why I want to become a traveling vlogger, here are some points. First of all, through traveling, you can broaden your horizon, appreciate a lot of majestic sceneries and experience various customs and cultures in different places. And comparied with 9 to 5 workers, you are free and you can escape from the restrictions from the environment. And if your videos are of good quality, you can gain a lot of followers and then you don't have to worry about the economic income.

### 13. Describe a piece of good news that you heard about someone you know well

Well, a few months ago, my friend Jack shared some good news with me. He told me that he passed a difficult exam called the National Judicial examination. It's one of the most difficult qualification exams in China. The pass rate is only about 10% every year. Plus, you have to read and study lots of law books. In fact, many people around me failed the exam. Some of them didn't even finish it. So I really admire him for passing it.

Actually Jack and I are close friends. Our friendship has lasted over a decade. I know how hard he worked because we chat from time to time. He made a study schedule and tried him best to stick to it for half a year. During those six months, he didn't socialize at all. He took lots of online classes and studied law for hours every day. To be honest, I've never seen anyone who could work that hard.

So, when he told me that he passed the exam by a lot, I was so happy for him. It was a great sense of accomplishment for him. Plus, he's finally qualified to be a lawyer. That means I'm going to have a lawyer friend! I'm very proud of him.

### 15. Describe a time when you missed or were late for an important meeting/event

### 16. Describe an activity you enjoyed in your free time when you were young

One of my favourite activities when I was a child was cycling. You know, when I was young, I was an active kid. I loved to run around. So when I learned how to ride a bike around the age of 10, I thought that I had found my passion. I literally rode my bike everywhere.

My neighbor, Jack, was the friend who rode with me the most. He is two years older than me.
Since we're almost the same age, we became friends right away. We both like cycling. When we were in middle school, Jack liked to discover more unusual cycling trails every weekend. He always persuaded me to ride somewhere far and challenge ourselves on more difficult routes. It made cycling really fun.

Besides, in our hometown, there's a long bike path along the lake. We loved to have cycling races along the lake. We pretended that we were professional athletes and always had so much fun cycling together. When we got tired, we laid on a nearby grass land and enjoyed the warm sun. It felt amazing.

So cycling was my favorite thing to do back then. I would ride around the town for an entire afternoon until my mother yelled at me to do my homework. Those bike rides were definitely the best part of my childhood.

### 17. Describe a time when you taught a friend/relative something

Three years ago I taught my cousin mathematics.

He was not good at math and always got distractions from class since he could't understand what the teacher had taught in class.

After getting dispirited for study, he decided to become an apprentice in an auto repair shop. However, several months later, he realized the importance of knowledge and diploma, so he came back and asked for my help since my major is mathematics. I promised his resquest for two main reasons. On the one hand, it would help him to pass the College Entrance Examination, which was vital for his future. On the other hand, our friendship would be strengthened.

First of all, I made a detailed time-table for him to follow. Then not only did I teach him the basic knowledge, but I also imparted him many useful problem solving techniques. When he was frustrated, I would gave him a pep talk to lift up his spirit.

Finally, he succeeded in passing the examination and appreciated my help. And I also felt a sense of achievement from this experience.

### 18. Describe an unusual meal you had

Last year I enjoyed an unusual meal on a home party which was launched and organized by the class monitor.

Before the party, we made some preparations. First of all, a questionnaire was conducted to check how many students would like to take part in the party. After that, we made a shopping list and then went to a supermarket to buy the raw materials needed for cooking dinner.

We arrived at the destination at around 6 pm and then began to make the dinner. Everything was delicious and we had a pleasant conservation with each other.

After the dinner, we enjoyed the snacks that we had bought in the supermarket and we did many interesting activities such as playing billiards(台球), singing, playing table games and video games.

I think this meal is unusual because it is the first time for the classmates to gather together to eat a meal and through the activity we get to know each other better. What's more, the party house is beautifully decorated, which has left me a deep impression.

Overall, it is an unforgettable experience and I really love this meal. I'm looking forward to it for the next time.

### 19. Describe a historical period/moment you would like to learn more about

I'd love to learn more about the reign of Wu Zetian. She's an amazing historical figure because she was the first and only Empress in all of China's history.

If memory serves correctly, I first became interested in Wu Zetian several years ago. I was watching a historical drama all about her rise to power and what her life was like as Empress. It totally hooked me.
Normally I don't care much about history. But her story was so fascinating.

Based on the show, I know that she started as a concubine of Emperor Taizong. But then, after he died, she married his ninth son and became an empress consort. Even though she was the Emperor's wife, most historians consider her to be the powerful one in their relationship. She was known to be a very intelligent and influential woman. Then, when he died, she gained total control of the throne and began the Zhou dynasty.

You know, it's amazing to hear about a female ruler in a time where it was very uncommon for women to have that much influence. I definitely think she's someone to look up to. So I hope to discover more about her. I was especially curious about things like if she encountered any sexism even though she was the ruler of the empire. Plus, I hope to learn about how she was perceived by commoners. I'll invest some time in reading more historical books to learn more about those aspects.

### 22. Describe your first day at school that you remember

Well, I remember the first day of my college so clearly. I really looked forward to starting this new journey. But I have to say the first day was such a roller coaster.

I arrived at the university's gate on the registration day. There were a lot of booths. A group of senior students were there as volunteers. After the paperwork was done, a senior student named Penny was assigned to lead me to my dorm.

She gave me a tour of campus. She was so nice and patient. I mean, I had tons of questions. But she answered all of them in detail. She even gave me her phone number in case I had more questions.
Her amazing personality really impressed me. Most importantly, she was so pretty. Honestly, I had a crush on her. When we were walking around campus, I was thinking about asking her out on a date

At the end of the tour and orientation, we arrived at the student residence. She congratulated me again. Then she told me that her boyfriend lived in my building... I was so disappointed when she said that. I tried to stay calm. But I was so upset. It was a great day overall... I just didn't expect to have those kinds of ups and downs.

### 23. Describe something you did that made you feel proud

When it comes to something I did that made me feel proud, I'm going to talk about the time my essay won an award. *If memory serves correctly*, this happened two years ago. Since I was interested in literature, I took part in an optional literature course. Although reading and writing about literature has never been one of my strong suits. I still really enjoyed the course.

Our final assignment was a ten-page paper. I was really stressed about the assignment. I met with the professor and told her my idea. She said that it sounded good and gave me some tips on how to write a strong essay. I decided that I would do my best, even though I was overwhelmed.

I had my work carved out for me, so I got rid of distractions and worked on the paper for three days straight. I stayed at the library for hours on end working away at it. It was pretty tough to stay focused, but I wanted to do a good job. Through lots of focus and hard work, I managed to finish the essay on time.

After the semester ended, my professor told me that she had nominated my essay for an award. Then, a few months later, I found out that I won! I was over the moon. All my hard work paid off in an amazing way. It felt so good to earn recognition for my work.

### 26. Describe something that you did with someone/a group of people

I'd like to talk about my experience of making a presentation with my classmates in college. When I was a freshman, I took a course in history. During one class, the teacher asked us to have a discussion on history and culture. He divided the class into groups, and asked each group to make a presentation one week later.

At that time, we had just entered college and didn't know each other, so when we were assigned to a group, we were shy and didn't know how to start the group project. That is, until one of the boys, Jack, volunteered to be the group leader. He let everyone introduce themselves first, which made us
more relaxed.

However, we still had no idea how to go about the presentation. As history and culture are big topics, we didn't know where to start. But Jack stepped up and led us each to discuss our understanding of the topic. It was like a big brainstorming session. We began forming plans and ideas piece by piece. He even provided specific sources for research. Some of us went to the library, some searched the Internet, and others even watched TV for information.

With Jack's leadership, we did a great job presenting. Our teacher also complimented us on it.
Each member of our group got high marks in that assignment. We were all very grateful to Jack, and we became closer because of this group project. Honestly, it was one of the best teams I've ever joined in my life.

我想说的是大学时候和同学们一起做课堂报告的经历。我在大一时，曾经上过一段时间历史课。有一次历史老师组织大家针对历史文化进行过论，并且给全班分了组，要求一周后每一组都做小组报告。

那时候我们都刚进大学校门没多久，彼此还不是很熟悉，所以一开始被分到一个组的时候，我们都有点害羞，也不知道该怎么开始这个小组作业，直到其中一个男孩 Jack 主动承担起小组长的角色。他让大家做了自我介绍，慢慢气氛变得轻松了很多。

但是对于如何做课堂报告我们还是一头雾水，因为历史和文化是很大的主题，我们不知道要从哪里开始。这时候，Jack 主动站出来，引导我们每个人讲了自己对话题的理解。这就像是上了一节头脑风暴课一样。我们逐渐开始一点点地有了思路和想法。Jack 甚全还具体分配了去哪里查找资料。有人去图书馆，有人去网上搜，还有人甚至去电视节目里找可用的信息。

因为 Jack 的领导，我们那次的小组汇报做的非常好。老师也给予了我们极大的肯定，那次作业我们组的人分数都很高。我们都非常感谢 Jack，而且因为这次小组活动，我们几个也变得更亲密了。老实说，那是我加入过的最棒的一个小组。

### 27. Describe a time when someone gave you something that you really wanted

I'd like to talk about getting a pair of noise-cancelling earbuds that I wanted. A few months ago, 1 saw a pair of Bluetooth noise cancelling earbuds online. They're a pair of JBL brand earbuds and cost around 1000 Yuan. They were pretty expensive, so I didn't buy them.

Actually, I really wanted those earbuds because at the time, I was busy preparing for lots of difficult exams. So I was really stressed. What's worse, I found myself often distracted by noise around me, especially people talking. Then I learned online that a pair of noise cancelling earbuds could help me out. So I was eager to try them.

Unfortunately, I couldn't afford the earbuds. But when I told my mom about them on the phone, she sent me a package with Apple noise-cancelling earbuds. They were more expensive than the ones I wanted. She said she hoped they would help me with my studies. I was so touched.

It turned out that the earbuds worked great. Once I put them on, I can't hear any external noise.
It makes me way more productive while studying. Sometimes, I even wear them to bed. It helps me fall asleep more quickly. So, thanks to my mom, I always have my noise-cancelling earbuds with me.
I'm truly grateful for everything my mom does to help me out.

### Describe a time when you needed to search for information

I can still remember there was a time when I have to look for some information to give a presentation about Chinese Space industry.

Since I was not really familiar with this area, it was necessary for me to search for some information to guarantee the quality of the presentation.

I used Baidu, a search engine, to investigate the development and achievement of Chinese Space industry, such as how the rocket manufacturing process has been developed, how many chinese astronauts have been sent into space and what scientific experiments have been carried out in the past several decades. What's more, I asked some of my friends who are space enthusiasts to give me some advice on how to organize the presentation contents to make it more clearly and they also provided me some extra details about Chinese Space industry which were very interesting.

Finally the presentation was successful and I won the applause from my classmates. I really appreciated the power of the Internet and the help of my friends. From this experience I have learned that the resources around us are sometimes complementary and we can combine them properly to get the information we want.

### Describe a problem you had while shopping online or in a store

For this topic, I want to talk about a shopping experience when I bought a book online several months ago.

Due to the study and research needs, I had wanted to buy that book for a long time. But the book hadn't been reprinted since 20 years ago, it was difficult to find it in the surrounding brick-and-mortar bookstores. So I had to search for it on the online stores. Luckily, I finally found one store selling it several months ago and I placed an order without any hesitation.

Several days later I received the package with excitement. However, when I opened the package, it turned out that the book was a second-hand book and there were many handwritten notes on it. I was annoyed at this since the shopkeeper had never told me about it. So I contacted the customer service staff and sent the photo of the book to him because I need an explanation for this kind of circumstance.

The staff admitted that it was their mistake and he promised to sent me a new book within three days. But I just rejected him and asked for a refund since I had no reliance for this shop anymore.

From this experience I have learned that when we shop online, we should differentiate between the stores to choose those with better quality goods and services. And if our consumers' rights and interests are compromised, we should actively defend them.
