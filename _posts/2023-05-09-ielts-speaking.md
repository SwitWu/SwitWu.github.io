### Rain

1. Do you like rainy days?  
   That depends on whether the rain is heavy or not. I am fond of some light rain since it can make the air fresher and make the weather cooler. But I don't like the heavy rain since it can wet my pant leg.

   I would choose to live in a dry city because it is possible and convenient for me to go out to do some sports, meet with my friends or just take a walk on sunny days. And when it's rainy, I can only stay at home, which is pretty boring.

### Day Off

1. What do you do on your day off?  
   Typically I'll stay in the dormitary to watch some videos, listen to the music or just have a sleep if I'm too tired. However, if I feel energetic, I'll invite my friends to play the table tennis, which is my favorite sport.
2. Do you usually spend your days off with your parents or your friends?  
   I usually spend my days off with my friends because I'm living in the school and I hardly have the chance to go home and see my parents. And on my days off, I usually eat a meal or do some sports together with my friends. Last week, I invited my fellow apprentice to eat in a bistro where the cuisines are really delicious.

### Bags

1. Do you usually carry a bag?  
   Yes. Basically I carry a bag everyday. Since  every morning I have to take many items such as my books, my personal computer, my water bottle and my keys with me, a bag is necessarily needed to put them all together.

   I would like to carry a middle-sized backpack which can just contain all the items I need to take along. As for the color, I'll choose some dark color such as black or dark blue which just fit my taste.
3. Do you change your bags often?  
   No. I think it's unnecessary to change bags often. In my opinion, bags are just for practical use and I won't change my bag until it is broken. I have used my current bag for five years and it's still in good condition. I think maybe I'll use it for another five years.

### Describe your favorite place in your house where you can relax

I think it must be my study, which is a small room in my house but I like it very much.

There is a personal computer on the table, many books on the bookshelf and there are several movie posters on the wall.

If I want to stay alone to relax, I will go to the study because my parents and friends won't interrupt me when I'm in the study. And I can read some books, have a cup of coffee or watch a great movie, which I enjoy very much.

If I'm tired, I can just take a nap on the sofa and forget all the troubles in daily life for a while.

Therefore, I think the study is my favorite place to relax.

+ Why is it difficult for some people to relax?

+ What are the benefits of doing exercise?  
  The benefits of exercising are numerous, making it an essential component of a healthy and balanced lifestyle. 锻炼的好处非常多，这使得其成为健康均衡的生活方式的重要组成部分。  
  Exercise can help to improve cardiovascular health, increase flexibility and strength, boost mood, and reduce the risk of chronic health conditions.  
  Additionally, physical activity has been shown to help individuals manage stress and anxiety, improve sleep, and increase energy levels.  
  Engaging in regular exercise can also lead to improved self-esteem, increased confidence, and a greater sense of well-being.
+ Do people in your country exercise after work?  
  Well, I think it depends on where people live. For those living in cities, there are enough sports facilities around their houses so they often exercise after work. But for those who live in the rural areas, sports amenities are not adequate so they may not do exercise as frequently as people in cities.
+ What is the place where people spend most of their time at home?  
  In most homes, I guess the place where people spend most of their time is the living room. The living room is used for entertaning guests, relaxing such as watching TV, spending time with family menbers and friends. And in the living room there is usually a big and confortable sofa which nearly nobody would show resistance to.
+ Do you think there should be classes for training young people and children how to relax?  
  Yeah. I think it's necessary to teach young people and children to learn how to relax. 




### Describe an unusual meal you had

Last year I enjoyed an unusual meal on a home party which was launched and organized by the class monitor.

Before the party, we made some preparations. First of all, a questionnaire was conducted to check how many students would like to take part in the party. After that, we made a shopping list and then went to a supermarket to buy the raw materials needed for cooking dinner.

We arrived at the destination at around 6 pm and then began to make the dinner. Everything was delicious and we had a pleasant conservation with each other.

After the dinner, we enjoyed the snacks that we had bought in the supermarket and we did many interesting activities such as playing billiards(台球), singing, playing table games and video games.

I think this meal is unusual because it is the first time for the classmates to gather together to eat a meal and through the activity we get to know each other better. What's more, the party house is beautifully decorated, which has left me a deep impression.

Overall, it is an unforgettable experience and I really love this meal. I'm looking forward to it for the next time.

### Describe a time when you taught a friend/relative something

Three years ago I taught my cousin mathematics.

He was not good at math and always got distractions from class since he could't understand what the teacher had taught in class.

After getting dispirited for study, he decided to become an apprentice in an auto repair shop. However, several months later, he realized the importance of knowledge and diploma, so he came back and asked for my help since my major is mathematics. I promised his resquest for two main reasons. On the one hand, it would help him to pass the College Entrance Examination, which was vital for his future. On the other hand, our friendship would be strengthened.

First of all, I made a detailed time-table for him to follow. Then not only did I teach him the basic knowledge, but I also imparted him many useful problem solving techniques. When he was frustrated, I would gave him a pep talk to lift up his spirit.

Finally, he succeeded in passing the examination and appreciated my help. And I also felt a sense of achievement from this experience.


### Describe a time when you needed to search for information

I can still remember there was a time when I have to look for some information to give a presentation about Chinese Space industry.

Since I was not really familiar with this area, it was necessary for me to search for some information to guarantee the quality of the presentation.

I used Baidu, a search engine, to investigate the development and achievement of Chinese Space industry, such as how the rocket manufacturing process has been developed, how many chinese astronauts have been sent into space and what scientific experiments have been carried out in the past several decades. What's more, I asked some of my friends who are space enthusiasts to give me some advice on how to organize the presentation contents to make it more clearly and they also provided me some extra details about Chinese Space industry which were very interesting.

Finally the presentation was successful and I won the applause from my classmates. I really appreciated the power of the Internet and the help of my friends. From this experience I have learned that the resources around us are sometimes complementary and we can combine them properly to get the information we want.

### Describe a website you often visit

For this topic, I would like a talk about a website called Math Stack Exchange, which is a forum for discussing various mathematical problems.

The layout of the website is very clear. The website is divided into two columns, the left of which lists the latest mathematical questions asked by different users and the right column contains the tags attached to the questions and many other hot network questions.（网站的布局）

And the website is very easy to use. There is a conspicuous button at the top-right corner of the website and if you want to ask a question, just click it, then write down your problem and what you have tried for the problem.（网站的使用）

I have used this website for several years. When I'm stuck with some very difficult questions that I can't resolve by myself, I'll resort to this website and typically within several hours someone will post a right answer under my question. What's more, sometimes I also help others on this site. For example, last week I saw an interesting question that is related to my research direction. It took me aroung two hours to solve the question but I felt really excited.

Overall, I have learned a lot from this website and I'll definitely recommend it to my classmates.
