## 图表类型

+ 数据类
  + line graph 线图
  + bar chart 柱图
  + pie chart 饼图
  + table 表格
  + 混合数据图
+ 非数据类
  + flow chart 流程图
  + map 地图

另外数据类又可以按照动态图和静态图来划分。

## 评分标准

小作文有四项评分标准，分别是：

+ TA (Task Achievement 任务完成度)
+ CC (Coherence and Cohesion 连贯与衔接)
+ LR (Lexical Resources 词汇丰富度)
+ GR&A (Grammatical Range & Accurary 语法范围与准确度)


## 动态图写作

### 首段改写

+ 改写的四要素：谓语动词（谓）、描述对象（主、宾）、时间、地点
+ 改写的三角度：同义替换、概括与具体、句式变换

#### 谓语动词的改写

+ 提供信息
  + give information about
  + provide
  + present
  + compare
+ 展示变化
  + illustrate/demonstrate changes of sth
  + illustrate how sth changed/varied

#### 描述对象的改写

+ information $\to$ data, statistics
+ figure $\to$ the amount/number/quantity of
+ proportion $\to$ percentage
+ kinds $\to$ types, categories, forms, groups, parts
+ men and women $\to$ males and females
+ people $\to$ individuals, person, population, residents, citizens
+ family $\to$ household, domestic
+ spending $\to$ costs, expenses, expenditure, budget

#### 时间的改写

+ 时间段的描述
  + from 2000 to 2020
  + between 2000 and 2020
  + over the period between 2000 and 2020
  + over the 2000--2020 period
  + over the 20-year period
  + over the two decades (特殊数据观察)
+ 时间点的描述：列举年份（当年份数 $\leq 3$）或概括年份数量

#### 地点的改写

单个地点时，考虑名词和形容词互换（如 people from America 换成 Amercian people）;多个地点时，列举地点名称或概括其数量。


### 结尾段（总结段）

+ 结尾段非常重要（没有结尾段 TA 不会超过 5 分）
+ 位置灵活，可以放在最后写，也可以放在第一段后面
+ 不要用 in conclusion 和 to conclude，建议用 overall, to sum up
+ 最好不要出现数据
+ 不要分析数据变化的原因，也不要给建议

### 动态图基本句型

1. 描述对象作主语
2. 变化趋势作主语
3. 时间作主语
4. There be 句型

> 举例：1920 年到 2019 年间，每周每个家庭花在家务事上的时间从 50 小时下降至 10 小时。
> 1. From 1920 to 2019, the number of hours spent on housework in a household per week decreased significantly from 50 hours to 10 hours.
> 2. A significant decrease from 50 hours to 10 hours occured in the number of hours spent on housework in a household per week during the 1920-2019 period.
> 3. The period between 1920 and 2019 witnessed a significant decrease from 50 hours to 10 hours in the number of hours spent on housework in a household per week.
> 4. There was a significant decrease from 50 hours to 10 hours in the number of hours spent on housework in a household per week between 1920 and 2019.


### 单线描写

#### 变化趋势、最高点、最低点

+ 四种变化趋势
  + 上升：increase, rise, grow, climb, soar, surge (最后两个慎用)
  + 下降：decrease, fall, go down, decline, drop, plunge, slump
  + 波动：fluctuate
  + 持平：level off at, remain the same at, remain unchanged at, stabilize at
+ 最高点
  + （名词）the peak/the top/the highest point $+$ at some amount
  + （动词）reach the peak at, increase to the peak at, peak at
+ 最低点
  + （名词）the bottom, the lowest point
  + （动词）reach the bottom at, decrease to the bottom at, bottom out at


> 例：Starting from 0 in 1960, this figure rose continually to its peak at about 15% in the first 2 decades.

#### 程度副词

+ 显著地：significantly, dramatically, drastically, sharply, notably, noticeably, markedly,  substantially, considerably
+ 轻微地：slightly, marginally, gradually
+ 适中地：modestly, moderately

主体段第一句常用：
+ According to $\cdots$
+ As is shown in $\cdots$

描述数据，表示大约、高于、低于、超过等的常见词汇：

+ 近似地、大约：about, around, approximately
+ 几乎：almost, nearly
+ 多达：up to, as much as
+ 高于：above, over, more than
+ 低于：below, under, less than
+ 仅仅：only, mere, merely
+ 超过：outnumber(在数量上超过), overtake [在描述动态图的交点时经常用]

> 例：In our office the women outnumber the men three to one.
我们办公室女性多于男性，比例为 3 比 1。
 

#### 主语的替换

重复使用相同的主语不太好，可以通过下面的方式将主语多样化：

+ 代词
+ 省略
+ 替换/改写

试比较下面两段话：

> According to the chart, at first, at 6am **the number of people** at the station stands at only 100. Then, **the number** shoots up over the next two hours and peaks at 400 at 8am. In the following 2 hours, **the number** declines rapidly and bottoms out at 180 at 10am. The period between 10 o'clock and 12 o'clock experiences a slight growth in **the number of people** in the station to 280 at midday.

> According to the chart, at first, at 6am **the number of people** at the
  station stands at only 100. Then, **it** shoots up over the next two hours and peaks at 400 at 8am. In the following 2 hours, **subway passengers/peope taking subway** declines rapidly and bottoms out at 180 at 10am. The period between 10 o'clock and 12 o'clock experiences a slight growth ~~in the number of people in the station~~ to 280 at midday.


#### 衔接与时间表达

+ at first, firstly, initially
+ then, next
+ after that, afterwards
+ from this time onwards, subsequently
+ finally

#### 句式变化（两段变化合并为一句）

+ 句型一
  + 基本句 before/after 基本句
  + After v-ing, 基本句
  + 基本句, before v-ing
+ 句型二
  + 基本句 when 基本句
+ 句型三
  + 基本句, after which + 基本句
  + 基本句, which was followed by + 趋势

#### 动态图分段原则

1. 按描述对象分段：当描述对象 $\leq 3$ 时，可为每个描述对象单独写一个主体段。
2. 按趋势分段：单图包含多条曲线，对应超过三种描述对象，需合并写。可根据不同变化趋势来分段。
3. 按大小分段：当趋势相同时，按大小分段。
4. 按时间点分段（较少出现）

### 动态图总结段

总结段写整体趋势和变化大小，注意，**总结段不要写数据**。


## 静态图写作

### 三种基本句型

1. 数据类型作主语： The proportion/number/amount of 描述对象 is 数据
2. 描述对象（类别限定）作主语：描述对象（类别限定） + 占 + 数据 of the total
    > 注意：“占”不用 occupy, take up, 而用 account for, make up, constitute, comprise, compose, represent
3. 数据作主语：数据 + 描述对象 + 谓语动词 + 类别限定


> 1. The proportion of tourists who came from China is 37%.
> 2. European tourists account for 35% of all the tourists going to Australia.
> 3. 18% the tourists going to Australia come from US.

### 引出数据的方式

+ **at**
  + 用在动词后
    > After peaking at 90 billions
  + 主语为对象词时
    > The figure for resources was the highest in 1991, at 20%.
+ **with** 经常用于句子主语不是 figure/number 这类词时
  > Petrol and oil are the dominant fuel sources throughout this period, with 35 quadrillion (35q) units used in 1980.
+ **(数据)** 括号经常跟在一个名词后面
  > European, with the highest overall percentage of land degraded (23%), also suffered from over-cultivation (7.7%) and over-grazing (5.5%).
+ **定语从句或现在分词作状语**
  > Heating is the largest energy consumer, (which uses)/(using) 42% of energy.

  > Energy consumed by heating accounts for the largest proportion, making up 42%.

### 排名第一的写法

可以用 the largest, the major, the most important 等表达，例如：

+ Coal was the major fuel source, which contributed 50 units.
+ The most important fuel was coal, which produced 50 units.

### 排名第二的写法

可以把实际数据替换为 relatively/comparatively smaller/lower，然后把
数据摆在最后面，例如：

+ The percentage of energy used by water heating is relatively smaller, at 30%.
+ A relatively smaller proportion of energy is used by water heating, standing at 30%.
+ Energy used by water heating accounts for a relatively smaller proportion of the total, 
  making up 30%.

也可以使用一些句型：

+ ... rank the second.
+ ... follow closely/behind.
+ ..., followed by ...
+ This is followed by ...

### 相等或相似的表达

+ be the same as
+ be as large(比例)/much(不可数名词)/many(可数名词) as
+ be equal to
+ equal
+ be similar to

在 be 动词后面可以加 approximately、nearly、basically、roughly、almost 等副词

> 举例：两种经典句式表示相似
> 1. A accounts for 40%, which is basically equal to B (39%).
> 2. A is basically the same as B, accounting for 40% and 39% respectively.

多个数值近似的数据合并描述，例如：
> The spending in the remaining countries was similar, ranging from 15% to 17%.

### 倍数关系

be + 数字 + as large/many/much as

> Energy used by water heating is 2 times as much as that used by other appliances, making up 30% and 15% respectively.

> The proportion of energy used by water heating is 2 times as large as that used by other appliances, at 30% and 15% respectively.

### 剩余部分及最小部分（饼图适用）

remaining, remainder, minimal, least, not significant, insignificant

### 主体段结构

+ 第 $1$ 句：概括由几部分组成
+ 后 $n$ 句：（具体来说）由大到小介绍具体数据（突出比较关系）

概括描述对象被分为 $n$ 类：

+ be classified/categorised/divided into
+ fall into
+ consist of, be made up of, be comprised of
+ constitute, compose
+ There be

> As can be seen from the pie chart, the places for teenagers to get online were classified into five types.

### 静态饼图写作思路

#### 单饼图

+ 排序法：按数据大小排序依次描述
+ 合并法：先写出最大两个类别的和，再分开列举数据；然后依次写剩余部分

#### 多饼图

+ 饼图之间没有关系的话，各写一段，最后总结
+ 饼图之间有关联的话，根据共同点分组，然后再逐个写

### 举例

</figure>

> Australian household energy use is divided into six parts.
  To be more specific, energy used by heating accounts for the largest proportion, making up 42%. A further 30% of energy is used by water heating, which is 2 times as large as the figure for other appliances (15%). The remaining 13% of energy is used by refrigeration, lighting and cooling collectively, constituting 7%, 4% and 2% respectively.
>
>  The situation for greenhouse gas emissions, however, is quite different. The largest proportion of greenhouse gas is emitted by water heating, standing at 32%, followed by other appliances (28%). It is worth mentioning that gas emissions caused by heating are approximately the same as those caused by refrigeration, with 15% and 14% respectively. Besides, lighting and cooling accounts for the remaining 11% of greenhouse gas.

</figure>

> The pie chart shows that there are four main causes of farmland becoming degraded in the world taday. Globally, 65% of degradation is caused by too much animal grazing and tree clearance, which degraded 35% and 30% respectively. A further 28% of global degradation in due to over-cultivation of crops. Other causes account for only 7% collectively.

> The six pie charts illustrate how much water is used for industry, agriculture and households in six regions around the world.
>
> In two regions, industry is the biggest consumer of water.
  In Europe, slightly over a half is used by this sector,
  while a third is for agricultural purposes. Households use the smallest amount, 15%. In North America, water use for agriculture constitutes 39% of the total, moderately higher than that in Europe. In addition, almost a half is consumed by industry, while domestic use represents merely 13%.
>
>  The other four regions saw great use of water in the        agricultural sector. Africa and central Asia use the largest amounts in agriculture, 84% and 86% respectively, while industry and households share the rest nearly equally. Around four fifths of all water consumed in Southeast Asia is for agricultural use. While 12% goes to industry, the remaining 7% is for domestic use. In South America, households are also the lowest consumer of water (one tenth), but industry uses almost twice as much. The remainder (71%) is all for agriculture.
>
>  In sum, the most developed areas among the six mainly use water for industry while the less
  developed ones use water mostly in the agricultural sector.
